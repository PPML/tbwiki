More than any single technology listed here, it's importantant to think about why we use the technologies we do. So far, I have seen no better explanation than the [Best Practices for Scientific Computing publication in PloS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745).

## Git

We use git. Git over it.

## Cluster Computing on Odyssey

Often times the resources necessary to run our model calibrations are larger than what our desktop computers can efficiently perform. In order to increase our productivity, we submit these larger tasks to a computing cluster. If you are not familiar with a cluster and how to submit your jobs, please review the text below; if you are familiar, feel free to jump to the "Request a cluster account section" below.

#### What is a cluster? 
Simply put, more machines = more redundancy and more power.
For a deeper explanation about clusters, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster). 

#### Using the cluster at Harvard
When you decide that your workflow can be improved by utilizing the cluster, you will need to request an account from the university. [Request a cluster account here](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/resources/faq/how-do-i-get-a-research-computing-account/). Once you are approved, you will be notified via email. It is recommended that you look through the resources provided by the FASRC for a brief introduction to using the cluster, found [here](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/introduction-to-cluster-online/). 

#### Cluster Basics 
##### Logging into the cluster 
  Open the terminal on your computer and type ssh USERNAME@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu. You will be prompted for your password & to two-factor authenticate.
